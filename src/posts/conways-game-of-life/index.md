A couple weekends ago, I decided to write an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).  This wasn't some kind of triumphant, "oh I'm so awesome at programming and I just want to tackle a puzzle" experience for me.  CoGL actually has a sort of special place in my heart as a big, scary Programming Interview Problem ™️.

The last time I tried to attempted to implement CoGL was (you guessed it) an interview situation.  I (mistakenly) decided to show up with minimal prep, and unsurprisingly, I did not perform as well as I should have.  I never revisited the problem, and it became a sort of "programmers [yips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yips)" situation for me.  After a year of mentally berating myself, I got sick enough of feeling bad that I just sat down to attempt an implementation again.  It did take longer than an hour length of an interview, but I'm pretty happy with the result.  More than the result, though, I'm really happy to have reclaimed a little bit of self confidence. 

Don't let your inner demons keep you from getting back on that horse.  I guarantee the effort of trying again is much less painful than feeling sorry for yourself.

Here's a demo:
