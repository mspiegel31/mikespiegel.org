A couple weekends ago, I decided to write an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).  This wasn't some kind of triumphant, "oh I'm so awesome at programming and I just want to tackle a puzzle" experience for me.  CoGL actually has a sort of special place in my heart as a big, scary Programming Interview Problem ™️.

The last time I tried to tackle this problem was (you guessed it) an interview situation.  The interview did not go well, mainly because I was unprepared and super nervous.  I left feeling pretty upset with myself.  I never revisited the problem because I was embarrassed, and it became a sort of "programmers [yips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yips)" for me.  After a year of feeling bad, I got sick enough of feeling bad that I just sat down to write it.  It did take longer than an hour length of an interview, but I'm pretty happy with the result.  Tackling it has really reinvigorated my self confidence.

Don't let your inner demons keep you from getting back on that horse.  I guarantee the effort of trying again is much less painful than feeling sorry for yourself.

Here's the [implementation](https://github.com/mspiegel31/conways_game_of_life) and a demo below.
